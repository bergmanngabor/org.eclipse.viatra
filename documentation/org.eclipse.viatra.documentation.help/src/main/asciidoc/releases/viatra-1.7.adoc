= VIATRA 1.7

== New and Noteworthy

=== Optimizations in Query Runtime

The memory usage of the query engine was optimized in several ways during VIATRA 1.7, ensuring the new version requires up to 50% less stable memory to index its contents. This reduction was mainly achieved by using compact collections provided by the http://eclipse.org/collections[Eclipse Collections] framework and creating custom tuple implementations.

Further changes also helped to reduce the temporary objects created during search-based pattern matching or provide faster responses in transformation by smarter preconditions checking.

*TODO* Execute and include a full performance measurement

=== Updated generated code structure

Traditionally, VIATRA generates four different Java classes for each query: (1) a _query specification_ class, (2) a _matcher_ class, (3) a _match_ class and (4) a _match processor_ class, each into a separate file. In case of projects with many pattern definitions, generating these files can get expensive.

In order to reduce the number of files generated, VIATRA 1.7 provides two new code generation option that creates only a single java file for each pattern:

 * *Generate into nested classes*: the match, matcher and match processor classes are generated as nested classes of the query specification; the query specification is renamed to have the same qualified name as the original pattern.
 * *Do not generate match and matcher classes*: no pattern-specific match, matcher and match processor classes are generated, but a generic implementation is reused. This mode is only recommended if the queries are not queried directly from code but used only in generic frameworks such as VIATRA Validation.

In VIATRA 1.7, for backward compatibility a third setting is used by default called *Generate into separate classes* that uses the previous structure. For VIATRA 2.0 it is planned to use nested classes as a default selection. This setting can be checked in the VIATRA Query Language compiler settings (available both as a global Eclipse Preference page or a Project Property page).

Additionally, the generation of pattern-specific match processors can be disabled if they are not used. This turns off the generation regardless whether it is generated into nested or separate classes.

=== CPS Demonstrator Application

VIATRA 1.7 includes a demonstrator application that can be used to see most features of the transformation framework in action. The application includes an example project and transformations included in editors. For more details about the transformation, have a look at the link:../cps/CPS-Application.html[corresponding documentation].

== Migrating to VIATRA 1.7

One of the reasons for the better memory usage are the compact collections provided by http://eclipse.org/collections[Eclipse Collections] framework. For this reason, all users of VIATRA has to have these classes available on the classpath. In case of dependencies managed via Maven or p2 this should require no additional steps, as this transitive dependency should be handled automatically.
