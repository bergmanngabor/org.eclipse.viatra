= Displaying Query Results in the User Interface
ifdef::env-github,env-browser[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]
ifndef::rootdir[:rootdir: .]
ifndef::imagesdir[:imagesdir: {rootdir}/../images]

As far as the visualization of VIATRA pattern matching results is concerned, the VIATRA framework provides two approaches:

* _VIATRA Data Binding Addon_: Using this addon, VIATRA pattern matches can be directly incorporated in newly developed applications that utilize JFace Data Binding.
* _VIATRA Viewers Addon_: The VIATRA Viewers component helps developing model-driven user interfaces by filling and updating model viewer results with the results of model queries. The implementation relies on (and is modeled after) the Event-driven Virtual Machine and JFace Viewers libraries.

== VIATRA Data Binding

VIATRA provides a simple data binding facility that can be used to bind pattern matches to UI elements. The feature is mainly intended to be used to integrate VIATRA queries to newly developed user interfaces. In order to utilize this functionality, the source patterns need to be annotated, and the used UI components need to be bound to the Observables provided by the data binding API. In the following sections an example is shown which uses VIATRA Data Binding.

=== Required annotations

* _@ObservableValue_: allows the developer to customize the appearance of a match. It defines an observable value (as defined in JFace Data Binding) which can be bound to an Eclipse/JFace UI.
** _name_ (String): the name of the parameter
** _expression_ (String): the attribute to be observed definition without '$' marks. For example `@ObservableValue(name = "id", expression = "host.identifier")`
** _labelExpression_: this annotation makes it possible to create observable string properties, which are useful when presenting relations between objects inside a JFace viewer component.

[[databinding-annotations]]

@ObservableValue(name = "id", expression = "host.identifier")
@ObservableValue(name = "node_ip", expression = "host.nodeIp")
@ObservableValue(name = "current_cpu", expression = "host.availableCpu")
@ObservableValue(name = "current_hdd", expression = "host.availableHdd")
@ObservableValue(name = "current_ram", expression = "host.availableRam")
@ObservableValue(name = "total_cpu", expression = "host.totalCpu")
@ObservableValue(name = "total_hdd", expression = "host.totalHdd")
@ObservableValue(name = "total_ram", expression = "host.totalRam")
pattern hostInstances(host: HostInstance) {
    HostInstance(host);
}

@ObservableValue(name = "id", expression = "app.identifier")
@ObservableValue(name = "state", expression = "app.state")
@ObservableValue(name = "db_user", expression = "app.dbUser")
@ObservableValue(name = "db_pass", expression = "app.dbPassword")
@ObservableValue(name = "allocatedTo", expression = "app.allocatedTo")
pattern applicationInstances(app: ApplicationInstance) {
    ApplicationInstance(app);
}

=== Listening to change via an Observable

There are some usecases where you don’t want to follow every change of a pattern’s match, just gather them together and process them when you’re ready. VIATRA Query provides several means of doing this, but we recommend using JFace databinding for basic purposes. To this end, the *ViatraObservables* utility class can transform the result set of your matcher into an observable list or set that can be tracked and even data bound easily. 

For headless (or non-UI thread) execution, please use the simple DefaultRealm implementation provided in the example (and invoke it on the appropriate thread). 

[[query-api-databinding]]
[source,java]
----
// (+) changes can also be tracked using JFace Databinding
// this approach provides good performance, as the observable callbacks are guaranteed to be called
//   in a consistent state, and only when there is a relevant change; anything
//   can be written into the callback method
// (-) * the databinding API introduces additional dependencies
//     * is does not support generics, hence typesafe programming is not possible
//     * a "Realm" needs to be set up for headless execution
DefaultRealm realm = new DefaultRealm(); // this is necessary for headless execution (or when you
// wish to execute outside of the UI thread. make sure to invoke it on the appropriate thread!
IObservableSet set = ViatraObservables.observeMatchesAsSet(matcher);
set.addSetChangeListener(new ISetChangeListener() {
 @Override
 public void handleSetChange(SetChangeEvent event) {
  for (Object _o : event.diff.getAdditions()) {
   if (_o instanceof EPackageMatch) {
    results.append("\tNew EPackage found by changeset databinding: " + ((EPackageMatch)_o).getP().getName()+"\n");
   }
  }
});
---- 

=== Using data binding to populate a table

[[databinding-table]]
[source,java]
----
//Initialize VIATRA query engine
ViatraQueryEngine engine = ViatraQueryEngine.on(new EMFScope(resourceSet));
//Get the matcher for the query to be observed (HostInstances pattern)
HostInstancesMatcher matcher = HostInstancesMatcher.on(engine);
//Create a generic data binding adapter for the query specification
//It is responsible for creating observable value properties based on the annotations of the pattern
GenericDatabindingAdapter adapter = new GenericDatabindingAdapter(HostInstancesMatcher.querySpecification());
//Bind the matches to the given TableViewer
ViewerSupport.bind(
    tableViewer,
    //Get the matching results as an observable list
        ViatraObservables.observeMatchesAsList(matcher),
        //Specify observed proeprties
        new IValueProperty[] {
        adapter.getProperty("id"),
        adapter.getProperty("node_ip"),
        adapter.getProperty("current_cpu"),
        adapter.getProperty("current_hdd"),
        adapter.getProperty("current_ram"),
        adapter.getProperty("total_cpu"),
        adapter.getProperty("total_hdd"),
        adapter.getProperty("total_ram") });
----

=== Master - detail data binding with a list

The following code fragment is responsible for binding a list to the results of a VIATRA query, and also displays match details in text boxes. (Uses Master-detail binding)

[[databinding-masterdetail]]
[source,java]
----
//Create new data binding context
//It will be used for binding the pattern match details
DataBindingContext dataBindingContext = new DataBindingContext();
//Initialize VIATRA query engine
ViatraQueryEngine engine = ViatraQueryEngine.on(new EMFScope(resourceSet));
//Get the matcher for the query to be observed (ApplicationInstances pattern)
ApplicationInstancesMatcher matcher = ApplicationInstancesMatcher.on(engine);
//Create a generic data binding adapter for the query specification
//It is responsible for creating observable value properties based on the annotations of the pattern
GenericDatabindingAdapter adapter = new GenericDatabindingAdapter(ApplicationInstancesMatcher.querySpecification());
//Bind the matches to the given ListViewer
ViewerSupport.bind(listViewer, ViatraObservables.observeMatchesAsSet(matcher), adapter.getProperty("id"));

//At this point, the results of the given pattern will appear in the list Viewer, the details however still need to be implemented
//Define target observable values for both textboxes
IObservableValue dbUserTarget = WidgetProperties.text().observe(dbUser);
IObservableValue dbPassTarget = WidgetProperties.text().observe(dbPass);

//Observe the changes in the list selection
IViewerObservableValue listSelection = ViewerProperties
    .singleSelection().observe(listViewer);

//Use the data binding context to bind the text property of the target textbox and the given property of the matcher.
dataBindingContext.bindValue(
    //Target textbox observable value
    dbPassTarget,
    //Get the source observable value from the adapter
    adapter.getProperty("db_pass").observeDetail(listSelection),
    //Define EMF update value strategy
    //In this case its one directional
    new EMFUpdateValueStrategy(UpdateValueStrategy.POLICY_NEVER),
    new EMFUpdateValueStrategy());

dataBindingContext.bindValue(dbUserTarget, adapter.getProperty("db_user").observeDetail(listSelection),
    new EMFUpdateValueStrategy(UpdateValueStrategy.POLICY_NEVER),
    new EMFUpdateValueStrategy());
----

[[viewers]]
== VIATRA Viewers

The VIATRA Viewers component can bind the results of queries to various JFace Viewers: JFace ListViewer and TreeViewers are currently supported. Additionally, by installing extra features from the extra update site GraphViewers (based on GEF4 Zest) are also supported. In the following example, and during the lab excersize as well, usage of GraphViewers will be presented. These GraphViewers are capable of displaying query results as graphs.

=== Usage

In order to use the VIATRA Viewers addon the following steps need to be undertaken:

* Annotate VIATRA query patterns with the @Item, @ContainsItem and @Edge annotations
** _@Item_ will be represented as a graph node
** _@ContainsItem_ will be represented as a node and an edge (edge is between the parent and child nodes)
** _@Edge_ will be displayed as an edge (targeted)
* Initialize the Viewers based UI component

=== Pattern Annotations

[[viewers-annotations]]
[source,vql]
----
//Host Type objects will be nodes of the displayed graph
@Item(item = host, label = "$host.identifier$")
//Format options can be set using the @Format annotation
@Format(color = "#0033CC", textColor = "#FFFFFF")
pattern hostTypes(host) {
    HostType(host);
}
//Host types contain host instances
//Displayed as nodes which have common edges with their parents
@ContainsItem(container = type, item = instance)
pattern connectTypesAndInstancesHost(type, instance) {
    HostType.instances(type,instance);
}
//Host instances can communicate with each other
//Displayed as an edge between the two nodes
@Edge(source = i1, target = i2, label = "comm")
pattern communications(i1, i2) {
    HostInstance.communicateWith(i1,i2);
}
----

=== Initializing a viewer programmatically

. Add a dependency to `org.eclipse.viatra.addon.viewers.runtime` (and `org.eclipse.viatra.addon.viewers.runtime.zest` if necessary) to your plug-in.
. Create a `ViewerState` instance from a group of query specification. Useful (static) helper methods are  available in the `ViatraViewerDataModel` class, that require a collection of query specifications; a data filter and the required features.
 * Collection of query specifications: only the query specifications with the corresponding Viewers annotations will be used; other specifications will be ignored.
 * ViewerDataFilter: it is used to filter the result of the queries by its parameters. For each pattern a separate filter can be initialized, that binds some of its parameters.
 * Required features: The ViewerStateFeature enum can be used to list the features required by the visualization. List viewers need no specific features; tree viewers require containment relations; Zest viewer requires edge relations (and possibly containment relations). Features not required will not create
. Use the corresponding bind methods from `ViatraViewers` or `ViatraGraphViewers` classes on a manually created `Viewer` together with the `ViewerState` and your instance model.
 * The `ViewerState` instance can be re-used between different viewers.
 * If the filters added to the `ViewerState` are changed, all the viewers will become obsolete, and have to be recreated.

[[viewers-code]]
[source,java]
----
//Create the graph viewer component and add it to the containing SWT control
GraphViewer viewer = new GraphViewer(parent, SWT.None);
//Create a new Viewer state based on the created VIATRA query engine and a set of annotated VIATRA query specifications
ViewerState state = ViatraViewerDataModel.newViewerState(getEngine(), getSpecifications(), ViewerDataFilter.UNFILTERED,
        ImmutableSet.of(ViewerStateFeature.EDGE, ViewerStateFeature.CONTAINMENT));
//This method of binding supports isolated nodes
ViatraGraphViewers.bindWithIsolatedNodes(viewer, state, true);
//Define layout algorithm
viewer.setLayoutAlgorithm(new SpaceTreeLayoutAlgorithm());
//Apply layout
viewer.applyLayout();
----

=== Examples

==== UML visualization
To illustrate the approach, a simple example was prepared in the link:http://git.eclipse.org/c/viatra/org.eclipse.viatra.git/tree/examples/papyrus-uml[examples repository of the VIATRA project] based on UML class diagrams. The examples are relying on the notion of example classes: _UML classes that do not have operations or properties (neither in their parent classes)_.

To present most features of the framework, four specific patterns are used (for the entire implementations visit the git repository):

. `pattern emptyClass (cl : Class)` - for listing all empty classes in the model
. `pattern nonEmptyClass(cl : Class)` - for listing all classes in the model, that are not empty
. `pattern superClass(sub : Class, sup : Class)` - for listing all direct superclass relations between classes
. `pattern transitiveSuperClass(sub : Class, sup : Class)` - for listing all indirect superclass relations between classes (but not the direct ones)

The visualizer illustrations below correspond to the link:http://git.eclipse.org/c/viatra/org.eclipse.viatra.git/tree/examples/papyrus-uml/org.eclipse.viatra.examples.uml.queries/testmodels/Testmodel.uml[test model] in the repository.

===== JFace List Viewer example
List Viewers can be used to display a collection of elements as a list. To define the list, only the `Item` annotation is used. Its `item` parameter selects a pattern parameter, representing the data to display, while its `label` parameter is used to define a label string (with the same syntax as the label features of Data Binding or the labels of Validation Framework.

[source,vql]
----
@Item(item = cl, label="Empty class $cl$")
pattern emptyClass(cl : Class) {
...
}

@Item(item = cl, label = "Class $cl$")
pattern nonEmptyClass(cl : Class) {
...
}
----

==== Binding contents to a JFace Tree Viewer
To support binding elements to a JFace Tree Viewer, in addition to the list of items, a set of containment relations needs also be specified using the <code>ContainsItem</code> annotation, that describes the container and contained items as pattern parameters. A containment reference is only displayed if both ends of the match result are present as Items in the viewer - otherwise it is simply ignored.

A unique property of the Tree Viewer support is that a single Item of the Viewers framework may appear multiple times in the tree. This happens if an element has multiple parents.

[source,vql]
----
@ContainsItem(container = sup, item = sub)
pattern superClass(sub : Class, sup : Class) {
...
}
@Item(item = cl, label="Empty class $cl$")
pattern emptyClass(cl : Class) {
...
}
@Item(item = cl, label = "Class $cl$")
pattern nonEmptyClass(cl : Class) {
...
}
----
image:addons/viewers_uml_tree.png[]

.Additional notes
* In addition to basic binding support where all items appear both as root and child items as needed, it is possible to limit Items to appear only as root or only as child positions using the hierarchy parameter.
* If creating a TreeViewer binding programmatically, and an item appear in multiple places, make sure you set up the `useHashLookup` property of your TreeViewer, otherwise the update of the TreeViewer would fail.

==== Zest Graph Viewer example

The definition of graph viewers requires a set of Items and a set of Edges. Edges are connecting two different Items; edges where the end points are not Items are not displayed. As opposed to the Tree Viewer support, a single item only appears once.

Additionally, based upon the formatting capabilities of Zest some basic display options are available in the form of `Format` annotation. The various parameters can be used to depict colors, line width, etc. If a selected format is not applicable for the current element, it is simply ignored.

[source,vql]
----
@Edge(source = sup, target = sub, label = "direct")
@Format(color = "#7f004b", lineWidth = 2)
pattern superClass(sub : Class, sup : Class) {
...
}
@Edge(source = sup, target = sub)
pattern transitiveSuperClass(sub : Class, sup : Class) {
...
}
@Item(item = cl, label="Empty class $cl$")
@Format(color="#3770d7", textColor = "#ffffff")
pattern emptyClass(cl : Class) {
...
}
@Item(item = cl, label = "Class $cl$")
pattern nonEmptyClass(cl : Class) {
...
}

=== Ecore visualization
We have developed another demonstrating example in the context of the headless example. As the queries of the headless example match against .ecore models (that is, EMF metamodels), the visualization example below can be used to visualize metamodels and containment relationships in a simple way. This example is focused mainly on the 2D graph visualization supported by the GEF5 Zest framework.

==== Specification
The example defines two graph node types and three graph edge types (link:http://git.eclipse.org/c/viatra/org.eclipse.viatra.git/tree/examples/headless/org.eclipse.viatra.query.application.queries/src/org/eclipse/viatra/query/application/queries/headlessQueries.vql[code]):

* Nodes are EPackage and EClass instances
* Edges are *classes contained in a package*, *subpackage* relationships, and a special transitive containment relationship between packages and classes *classes in a package hierarchy* that enumerates all classes that are contained by a root package or some subpackage (transitively) below this root.

[source,vql]
----
@Item(item = p, label = "P: $p.name$")
@Format(color = "#791662", textColor = "#ffffff")
pattern ePackage(p : EPackage) { EPackage(p); }

@Item(item = ec, label = "EC: $ec.name$")
@Format(color = "#e8da2c")
pattern eClass(ec : EClass) { EClass(ec); }

@Edge(source = p, target = ec, label = "classIn")
pattern classesInPackage(p : EPackage, ec: EClass) { EPackage.eClassifiers(p,ec); }

@Edge(source = p, target = sp, label = "sub")
pattern subPackage(p: EPackage, sp: EPackage){ EPackage.eSubpackages(p,sp); }

@Edge(source = rootP, target = containedClass, label = "classIn+")
@Format(color = "#0033ff")
pattern classesInPackageHierarchy(rootP: EPackage, containedClass: EClass)
{
	find classesInPackage(rootP,containedClass);
} or {
	find subPackage+(rootP,somePackage);
	find classesInPackage(somePackage,containedClass);
}
